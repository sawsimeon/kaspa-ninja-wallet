# Kaspa Ninja Wallet

  A secure, decentralized Kaspa wallet running on the Internet Computer (ICP) that demonstrates the power of chain fusion technology. Send and receive Kaspa (KAS) directly through a beautiful web interface powered
  by Internet Identity authentication and ICP's threshold ECDSA.

  This application showcases ICP's unique capabilities including:
  - **Internet Identity** for secure, passwordless authentication
  - **Threshold ECDSA** for cryptographic key management without storing private keys
  - **HTTP Outcalls** for real-time blockchain integration
  - **Chain Fusion** connecting Kaspa blockchain with the Internet Computer

  ## Features

  - ü•∑ **Ninja-themed UI** with modern glassmorphism design
  - üîê **Secure Authentication** via Internet Identity
  - üí∞ **Real Kaspa Transactions** with mainnet integration
  - üé® **Beautiful Interface** with Gen Z aesthetic and smooth animations
  - üì± **Responsive Design** that works on all devices
  - ‚ö° **Real-time Balance** updates and transaction status

  ## Deploying from ICP Ninja

  When viewing this project in ICP Ninja, you can deploy it directly to the mainnet for free by clicking "Run" in the upper right corner.

  Open this project in ICP Ninja: [Add your ICP Ninja link here]

  ## Project Structure

  The `/backend` folder contains the Motoko canister (`main.mo`) that handles:
  - Kaspa address generation using threshold ECDSA
  - Balance checking via HTTP outcalls to Kaspa network
  - Transaction building and broadcasting
  - Secure user authentication

  The `/frontend` folder contains the React application with:
  - Modern React UI with Vite build system
  - Internet Identity integration
  - Glassmorphism design with smooth animations
  - Responsive layout for all screen sizes

  Edit the `mops.toml` file to add Motoko dependencies. This project uses the `kaspa` package for blockchain integration.

  ## Technology Stack

  - **Backend**: Motoko with ICP's threshold ECDSA and HTTP outcalls
  - **Frontend**: React + Vite with modern CSS animations
  - **Authentication**: Internet Identity
  - **Blockchain**: Kaspa mainnet integration
  - **Styling**: Custom CSS with Space Grotesk font and glassmorphism effects

  About Chain Fusion

  This project demonstrates ICP's chain fusion capabilities by securely connecting to the Kaspa blockchain without bridges or wrapped tokens. The Internet Computer directly manages Kaspa private keys using threshold
   cryptography and executes transactions on the Kaspa network via HTTP outcalls.
